# To-Do List Project [LiveRun](https://deepakkumar55.github.io/ULTIMATE-JAVASCRIPT-PROJECT/Basic%20Projects/1-to_do_list)

## Description

The To-Do List project is designed to help users efficiently manage their daily tasks. This project demonstrates how to build a simple yet functional application using fundamental web development technologies. It allows users to add, update, and delete tasks, making task management straightforward and intuitive.

## Features

- **Add New Tasks**: Users can easily add new tasks by entering a task name and optional details in an input form. Each task is then added to the to-do list for tracking.
- **Mark Tasks as Complete**: Users can mark tasks as complete by clicking on them, which will visually differentiate completed tasks from those that are still pending.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can remove tasks that are no longer needed by clicking a delete button, ensuring their to-do list remains clean and organized.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Handles the dynamic aspects of the application, such as adding, updating, and deleting tasks.
- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the web page, including the form for adding tasks and the list for displaying them.
- **CSS**: Styles the application, ensuring it is visually appealing and responsive across different devices.
