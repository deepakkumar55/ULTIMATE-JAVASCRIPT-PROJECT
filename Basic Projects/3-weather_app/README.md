# Weather App [LiveRun](https://deepakkumar55.github.io/ULTIMATE-JAVASCRIPT-PROJECT/Basic%20Projects/3-weather_app)

## Description

This is a simple weather app that allows users to get current weather information for any location. The app uses an external weather API to fetch real-time weather data and displays it in a user-friendly interface. This project is ideal for learning how to work with APIs and building interactive web applications using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Features

- **Real-time Weather Data**: Fetch and display current weather information for any location.
- **Search Functionality**: Allow users to search for weather information by city name.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the app works well on various devices, including mobile phones and tablets.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: For fetching data from the weather API and updating the DOM.
- **HTML**: For structuring the app's interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the app and making it responsive.
